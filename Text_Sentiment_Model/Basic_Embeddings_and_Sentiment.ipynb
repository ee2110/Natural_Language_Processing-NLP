        "To create our embeddings, we’ll first use an embeddings layer, called `tf.keras.layers.Embedding`. This takes three arguments: the size of the tokenized vocabulary, the number of embedding dimensions to use, as well as the input length. The output of this layer needs to be reshaped to work with any fully-connected layers. Thus, `Flatten` or `GlobalAveragePooling1D` function is used."
